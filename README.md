# DAO Unifier Protocol

**A modular Clarity smart contract suite for enabling DAO interoperability, proposal aggregation, and cross-governance collaboration on the Stacks blockchain.**

---

## 📌 Overview

The **DAO Unifier Protocol** is a Clarity-based smart contract system that brings together decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) under a shared governance infrastructure. The protocol allows multiple DAOs to register with a central aggregator, submit proposals, receive funding, and coordinate decision-making across communities.

By providing a unified interface for governance, voting, and funding, this protocol encourages collaborative growth among decentralized communities and supports proposal discovery across DAO ecosystems.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🔗 **DAO Registration**: Individual DAOs can register and interact through a unified aggregator.
- 🗳️ **Proposal Lifecycle**: Submit, view, and vote on proposals across multiple DAOs.
- 💰 **Funding System**: Users can fund proposals in STX or wrapped tokens.
- 🧠 **Voting Power Mechanics**: Voting rights can be derived from tokens, activity, or STX holdings.
- 🎁 **Reward Distribution**: Rewards allocated to users participating in successful proposals.
- 🔒 **Permissionless Architecture**: Fully on-chain logic, no off-chain dependencies.
- 🧱 **Modular Contract Structure**: Each module is a standalone Clarity contract with a single responsibility.

## 🧩 Contract Modules

| File | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| `dao-unifier.clar` | Core contract: DAO registry, proposal aggregator |
| `dao-factory.clar` | Enables creation of new DAOs with predefined logic |
| `proposal.clar` | Proposal structure, submission, state transitions |
| `voting-power.clar` | Tracks and calculates voting rights |
| `funding.clar` | Accepts and manages funds for proposals |
| `rewards.clar` | Logic for distributing rewards |
| `utils.clar` | Common utility functions for reuse across contracts |

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

This project is built with [Clarinet](https://docs.stacks.co/docs/clarity/clarinet/overview/), the official Stacks smart contract development tool. To test:

```bash
# Install Clarinet if not yet installed
npm install -g @hirosystems/clarinet

# Check the contract syntax
clarinet check

# Run unit tests
clarinet test
```

All code is tested and verified with `clarinet check` to ensure correctness, completeness, and compliance with Clarity best practices.
